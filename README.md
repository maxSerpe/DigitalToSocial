# DigitalToSocial
Designed to measure the impact of digital media on social media platforms.

First Itteration: 
Collect ranges of information from Google News API and Twitter API. Feed these into PySpark, develop a set of adjustable parameters to allow the user to search for desired keywords. 
Example usage: 
User sets a timeframe, the keywords as ["COVID", "Covid-19"] for Google News, and ["masks"] for twitter. The project will then return usage metrics from both platforms for the occurence of the search terms, as well as the change in occurance from the N weeks.
